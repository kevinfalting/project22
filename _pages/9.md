'This doctrine, my friends, is reason and wisdom; but, after all,
do not depend too much upon your own industry, and frugality, and
prudence, though excellent things; for they may all be blasted without
the blessing of Heaven; and therefore, ask that blessing humbly, and be
not uncharitable to those that at present seem to want it, but comfort
and help them. Remember, Job suffered, and was afterwards prosperous.

'And now to conclude, "Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will
learn in no other," as Poor Richard says, and scarce in that; for it
is true, "We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct." However,
remember this, "They that will not be counselled cannot be helped;"
and farther, that "If you will not hear Reason, she will surely rap
your knuckles," as Poor Richard says.'

Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue. The people heard it, and
approved the doctrine, and immediately practised the contrary, just as
if it had been a common sermon; for the auction opened, and they began
to buy extravagantly.--I found the good man had thoroughly studied my
Almanacks, and digested all I had dropt on those topics during the
course of twenty-five years. The frequent mention he made of me must
have tired any one else; but my vanity was wonderfully delighted with
it, though I was conscious that not a tenth part of the wisdom was my
own, which he ascribed to me; but rather the gleanings that I had made
of the sense of all ages and nations. However, I resolved to be the
better for the echo of it; and, though I had at first determined to buy
stuff for a new coat, I went away, resolved to wear my old one a little
longer. Reader, if thou wilt do the same, thy profit will be as great
as mine.--I am, as ever, thine to serve thee,

RICHARD SAUNDERS.
