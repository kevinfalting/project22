he means, that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only, and not real;
or the bargain, by straitening thee in thy business, may do thee more
harm than good. For, in another place, he says, "Many have been ruined
by buying good pennyworths." Again, "It is foolish to lay out money
in a purchase of repentance;" and yet this folly is practised every
day at auctions, for want of minding the Almanack. Many a one, for the
sake of finery on the back, have gone with a hungry belly, and half
starved their families; "Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets, put out
the kitchen fire," as Poor Richard says. These are not the necessaries
of life; they can scarcely be called the conveniences: and yet only
because they look pretty, how many want to have them?--By these, and

does he that lends to such people, when he goes to get it in again.
Poor Dick farther advises, and says,

> "Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse,
^
> Ere fancy you consult, consult your purse."

'And again, "Pride is as loud a beggar as Want, and a great deal more
saucy." When you have bought one fine thing, you must buy ten more,
that your appearance may be all of a piece; but Poor Dick says, "It is
